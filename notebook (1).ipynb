The data contains 879 observation and 9 variables.*\n- **product_id and vendor_id:** Since the data has 879 rows, counting the number of unique values **product_id and vendor_id** helps determine if product id and vendor id are repeated or not. Indeed each has their unique identifier. Also, to meet the characteristics of **product_id**, it was converted to character using as.character().\n- **Sales** has dollar sign. Thus, for easier and accurate analysis it was removed. Then, sales converted to numeric. \n- **price** is also numeric so no further manipulation was needed.\n*We investigated if the data contains 11 product categories, 5 pet sizes, customer raring of the product on 10 point scale, determined number of pet types, re_buy either 1 or 0.*\n- **11 product category:** is character with these categories: \"Equipment\", \"Toys\", \"Snack\", \"Supplements\", \"Bedding\",   \"Medicine\", \"Housing\", \"Food\", \"Clothes\", \"Accessory\", \"Grooming\";  \n- **5 pet sizes:** is character with these categories: \"small\", \"large\", \"extra_small\", \"medium\", \"extra_large\";\n- **6 pet types:** is character with these categories: \"fish\", \"cat\", \"hamster\", \"dog\", \"bird\", \"rabbit\";\n- **ratings:** from 1 to 10, converted to numeric;\n- **re_buy:** is binary, converted to factor.\n\n*The marketing team requested to select only **cat, dog, bird and fish** products. Therefore, **hamster and rabbit** were removed from the analysis. We investigated on why the marketing team wanted only four pets for the subscription box, and we found out that hamster and rabbit products were not frequently bought by customers. After cleaning the data, the new data contains **833 observations.** We checked for missing values and there was none.* ","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"d1b1a012-1ccb-40e7-a1ad-77b60b256690","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Data Discovery and Visualization\n\n*Before answering the questions of the marketing team, let's get to know the data better:*\n","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![000017](000017.png)\n\nBased on the bar chart which gives the count of each pet category, most customer bought products for dogs and cats equally.","metadata":{},"id":"e0a78aca-8af0-40b7-8993-e2d5e82d7f96","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![ProductCategory](ProductCategory.png)\n\n*The donut chart reveals that that the most common product categories are **equipment, snacks,  and toys**.
